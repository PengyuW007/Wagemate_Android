# WageMate

## Overview
When the job hunters are browsing the job market, some companies list the hourly wages, and rest of them 
list the annual wage. Hence, **WageMate** is a salary calculator designed to help users determine their **net annual salary** 
after tax deductions based on their **hourly wage, worked hours, or annual salary**. 
The app automatically applies federal and provincial tax rates to provide an accurate estimate of take-home pay.

## Features
- **Hourly Wage Calculation**: Computes annual salary based on hourly wage and worked hours.
- **Annual Salary Calculation**: Accepts direct annual salary input for tax computation.
- **Automatic Tax Deduction**: Applies federal and provincial tax rates based on user-selected location.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures data accuracy by verifying the consistency of user-provided wages.
